=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are a number of modules on CPAN that allow users to write their classes
with a more "modern" syntax. These tools eliminate the need to shift off
C<$self>, can support type checking and offer other improvements.
Unfortunately, they can break the support tools that the Perl community has
come to rely on. This module attempts to work around those issues.

The module uses
L<Perl::Tidy>'s C<prefilter> and C<postfilter> hooks to support C<method> and
C<func> keywords, including the (possibly multi-line) parameter lists. This is
quite an ugly hack, but it is the recommended method of supporting these new
keywords (see the 2010-12-17 entry in the Perl::Tidy
L<CHANGES|https://metacpan.org/source/SHANCOCK/Perl-Tidy-20120714/CHANGES>
file). B<The resulting formatted code will leave the parameter lists untouched.>

C<Perl::Tidy::Sweetened> attempts to support the syntax outlined in the
following modules, but most of the new syntax styles should work:

=over

=item * p5-mop

=item * Method::Signatures::Simple

=item * MooseX::Method::Signatures

=item * MooseX::Declare

=item * Moops

=item * perl 5.20 signatures

=item * Kavorka
